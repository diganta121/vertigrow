#Vertigrow

By 2050 we’ll need to feed almost 10 billion people. How can we do that without overwhelming the planet? The World's Population Is Growing Much Faster Than We think. A rapidly growing population, large scale deforestation , climate change and every kind of pollution we can imagine…… How many more generations do you think humanity can hold on.

Our project aims at feeding people. SO how do we feed such an ever increasing population? Before we begin let me tell you what is wrong with conventional farming. It has constraints, it is limited by a lot of factors…how much agricultural land we have, the amount of nutrients available in the soil etc etc… Vertical farming is growing crops in vertically stacked layers. It often incorporates controlled-environment agriculture.

#Why Is this so good?
It generates more yield with less space and resources and uses less to no pesticides.

#Aeroponics?
Our project also involves aeroponics. Aeroponics is like a much more efficient brother of hydroponics. Aeroponics is the process of growing plants suspended in an air or mist environment without the use of soil, that is you can mist nutrient water directly into the roots. atomizers are used to produce fine mist, Here Roots will have more access to oxygen and humidity, they grow larger and yield far bigger numbers than traditional farming methods. Generally, it also uses less water over time since excess water not absorbed by the roots is drained back, and the mist allows for higher concentrations of nutrients with less liquid.

#Data collection from plants is the future of farming.

Data based decisions at the farm level can improve resource utilisation and conservation practices. We can collect from plants all the data we want using sensors.
